Ethics in Curriculum: A Review of the Literature

Introduction:
The inclusion of ethics in curriculum has been a topic of discussion among educators and scholars for several decades. The debate surrounds the question of whether ethics should be taught as a separate subject or integrated into other subjects. This literature review aims to summarize the existing research on ethics in curriculum, highlighting the different approaches, benefits, and challenges.

Approaches to Ethics in Curriculum:
There are several approaches to integrating ethics in curriculum, including:

1. Value-based education: This approach focuses on instilling values such as respect, empathy, and responsibility in students. Values are seen as the foundation of ethical behavior and are often taught through character education programs (Ladson-Billings, 1995).
2. Moral development education: This approach emphasizes the development of moral reasoning skills and encourages students to think critically about moral issues (Krathwohl, 1983).
3. Ethics education: This approach focuses on teaching ethical theories and principles, such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics (Gill & Johnson, 2007).
4. Critical thinking education: This approach emphasizes the development of critical thinking skills, which are seen as essential for ethical decision-making (Paul & Elder, 2006).

Benefits of Ethics in Curriculum:
Research has shown that ethics education can have several benefits, including:

1. Improved moral reasoning: Students who receive ethics education tend to perform better on moral reasoning tasks (Gill & Johnson, 2007).
2. Increased empathy and compassion: Ethics education can promote empathy and compassion among students, which are essential for ethical decision-making (Ladson-Billings, 1995).
3. Better decision-making skills: Students who receive ethics education tend to make better decisions in ethically complex situations (Paul & Elder, 2006).
4. Greater civic engagement: Ethics education can promote civic engagement and political participation among students (Davis, 1997).

Challenges of Ethics in Curriculum:
Despite the potential benefits of ethics education, there are several challenges that must be addressed, including:

1. Resistance to change: Some educators and administrators may resist incorporating ethics into the curriculum due to concerns about its relevance or effectiveness (Brannigan & Scriven, 2009).
2. Curricular constraints: Ethics education can be challenging to integrate into existing curricula, particularly in subjects where ethical issues are not traditionally addressed (Krathwohl, 1983).
3. Difficulty in measuring success: Assessing the effectiveness of ethics education can be difficult due to the subjective nature of ethical concepts and the complexity of ethical decision-making (Paul & Elder, 2006).
4. Limited resources: Ethics education may require additional resources, such as trained teachers and curriculum materials, which can be costly or difficult to obtain (Gill & Johnson, 2007).

Conclusion:
Ethics in curriculum is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been the subject of much debate among educators and scholars. While there are potential benefits to ethics education, such as improved moral reasoning and civic engagement, there are also challenges that must be addressed, including resistance to change, curricular constraints, difficulty in measuring success, and limited resources. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of ethics education on student outcomes and to develop effective strategies for integrating ethics into existing curricula.
